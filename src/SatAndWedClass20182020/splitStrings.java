split strings (no DFS / BFS)
A string S of lowercase English letters is given.
We want to split this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part,
and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
Example 1:
Input: S = “ababcbacadefegdehijhklij”
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The split is “ababcbaca”, “defegde”, “hijhklij”.
